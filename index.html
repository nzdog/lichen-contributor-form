    <h1>Workplace Transition Reflection</h1>
    <p>This is a space to reflect during organizational change. No pressure, no performance. Just a place to see what’s already true.</p>

    <form id="transitionForm">

      <label for="stable">1. What part of your current work feels most stable right now?</label>
      <div class="why">Why this matters: Amid change, it helps to name what hasn’t moved. Steadiness creates orientation.</div>
      <div class="examples">Examples: “My sprint rhythm.” / “The product roadmap.” / “How I work with my immediate team.”</div>
      <textarea id="stable" name="stable" rows="4" required></textarea>

      <label for="shifting">2. What part of your role is quietly shifting—even if nothing official has changed?</label>
      <div class="why">Why this matters: Change often starts subtly. Naming the early shifts helps you stay present and adaptive.</div>
      <div class="examples">Examples: “I’m getting pulled into higher-level decisions.” / “Meetings feel more cautious.”</div>
      <textarea id="shifting" name="shifting" rows="4" required></textarea>

      <label for="signals">3. What signals are you tracking right now—formally or informally?</label>
      <div class="why">Why this matters: You’re already watching the field. Writing it down helps you work with the pattern, not just react to it.</div>
      <div class="examples">Examples: “Leadership tone.” / “Slack energy.” / “Increased visibility on KPIs.”</div>
      <textarea id="signals" name="signals" rows="4" required></textarea>

      <label for="patterns">4. What patterns in yourself are showing up more strongly during this period?</label>
      <div class="why">Why this matters: Transitions amplify habits—helpful or otherwise. Awareness creates choice.</div>
      <div class="examples">Examples: “I’m over-preparing.” / “Avoiding meetings.” / “Working late even when I don’t need to.”</div>
      <textarea id="patterns" name="patterns" rows="4" required></textarea>

      <label for="support">5. What would help you stay steady without isolating?</label>
      <div class="why">Why this matters: You don’t have to hold everything alone. This names what might keep you supported and intact.</div>
      <div class="examples">Examples: “A check-in with someone I trust.” / “Clearer direction about what not to worry about.”</div>
      <textarea id="support" name="support" rows="4" required></textarea>

      <label for="notYet">6. What’s one decision you’re not ready to make yet—and that’s okay?</label>
      <div class="why">Why this matters: Naming what’s unresolved helps protect signal. You don’t have to force clarity too soon.</div>
      <div class="examples">Examples: “Whether I want to lead this project long-term.” / “How this shift fits into my own path.”</div>
      <textarea id="notYet" name="notYet" rows="4" required></textarea>

      <label for="rhythm">7. If you were to move through this with rhythm, not reaction—what would that look like?</label>
      <div class="why">Why this matters: Clarity doesn’t always mean speed. You get to choose how you move through this.</div>
      <div class="examples">Examples: “Protecting focus hours.” / “Speaking slower.” / “Waiting a beat before responding.”</div>
      <textarea id="rhythm" name="rhythm" rows="4" required></textarea>
